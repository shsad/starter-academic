summary: ""
abstract: "We review classical and modern results in approximation theory of neural
networks. First, the density of neural networks within different function
spaces under various assumptions on the activation function is considered.
Next, lower and upper bounds on the order of approximation with neural
networks are given based on the input dimension, the number of neurons
and a parameter quantifying the smoothness of the target function. Lastly, a
family of compositional target functions for which the curse of dimensionality
can be overcome using deep neural networks is examined."
